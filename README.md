# RSPC Compiler

RSPC Compiler Compiles a file called code.txt into a minecraft command. When used, you must make sure that code.txt is in a directory called Input.

Compiler.py\
Input\
└─code.txt

There is also a compiled version of the Compiler as an executable, which you can run using the same logic.
